This is the main repo for the WIP Mabel compiler.

## Development

For ease of development, there're several [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) tasks.

        end
        subgraph JsCdoeGenGraph[ ]
            direction TB
            JsAst{{JavaScript AST}} --> JavaScript[JavaScript Code]
        end
        Start([âœ… Lib Frontend]) -->  ParserGraph
        ParserGraph --> CompilerGraph
        CompilerGraph --> LLVMCodeGenGraph
        CompilerGraph --> JsCdoeGenGraph
    end
```

### Build and Run

This is equivalent to running `RUSTFLAGS="-Awarnings" cargo run -q -- [...args]`.
This will suppress rustc warnings and cargo outputs to make it feel like running the executable itself.

```
cargo make mabel-dev [...args]
```

### Testing

This is equivalent to running `cargo test [...args]`.

```
cargo make test [...args]
```

### Coverage

This is equivalent to running `cargo llvm-cov args`. [cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) needs to be installed.

```
cargo make coverage [...args]
```

As of now, I can't write test cases for all modules since working with AST is very inconvenient given that AST contains kind, token, etc.

Those files will be later tested with [mabel source codes](tests) when, at least, the JIT execution engine is finished.
